# 2D Game with functional JS

An experiment to develop a 2D game using functional Javascript principles rather than Object Oriented Programming.

This is the first time I've tried this out as I'm more used to OOP for games, I'm really enjoying working on this and it seems that functional programming is a lot easier to reason about for me.
